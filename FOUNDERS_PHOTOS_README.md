3. `per.3.jpg` - Founder 3 photo
4. `per.4.jpg` - Founder 4 photo

## Customizing Founder Information

After adding the photos, update the founder names, roles, and contributions in:
`src/components/FoundersModal.tsx`

Edit the `founders` array (lines 19-50) with the actual founder information:

```typescript
const founders: Founder[] = [
  {
    name: 'Your Name',
    role: 'Your Role',
    contribution: 'Brief description of their contribution to the platform.',
    photo: '/per.1.jpg'
  },
  // ... etc
];
```
